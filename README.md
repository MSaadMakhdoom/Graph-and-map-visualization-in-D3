# Graph and map visualization in D3
#### Graph and map visualization as the data consists of geo-spatial and temporal data, therefore three visualizations
- Map visualization (to represent geo-spatial data)
- Graph Visualization (to represent geo-spatial data)
- Timeline visualization (to represent temporal data)

# Map visualization (to represent geo-spatial data)
- For this map visualization. First render the GeoJson data file to be able to draw underlying map of London suburbs. After draw the map Represent all the stations as points (using their Lat-longs) and lines/edges to represent start-end stations. 
- Channelize the points and lines 
# Graph Visualization (to represent geo-spatial data)
- visualize the graph data.Represent the same graph data layout the nodes in  fashion and aggregate nodes under some criteria (e.g. all stations in a suburb) or all stations in the north, south etc. 
- This aggregation of nodes will let  achieve semantic zooming in this visualization.
# Timeline visualization (to represent temporal data)
- Timeline of the current provided data.
- Visual filter to let the user select timeline.

# All the visualizations in the dashboard  fully interactive (i.e. panning, zooming, selection etc.)
# The visualizations need to be linked via brushing and linking.
